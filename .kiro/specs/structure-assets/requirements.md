# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a structured approach to managing park structure assets, starting with lamp models. The system will provide a dedicated folder structure for organizing various park structures (lamps, benches, signs, etc.) and implement a lamp model that can be placed throughout the park environment to enhance the visual experience and provide functional lighting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a park designer, I want to organize structure assets in a dedicated folder structure, so that I can easily manage and maintain different types of park structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create a dedicated folder structure for park structure assets
2. WHEN organizing assets THEN the system SHALL separate different structure types (lighting, seating, signage, etc.) into logical subfolders
3. WHEN adding new structure types THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent naming and organization pattern

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a park designer, I want to create lamp models, so that I can add atmospheric lighting throughout the park.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a lamp model THEN the system SHALL define a basic lamp geometry with post and light fixture
2. WHEN rendering a lamp THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate materials and textures
3. WHEN a lamp is active THEN it SHALL emit light that affects the surrounding environment
4. WHEN placing lamps THEN the system SHALL support multiple lamp instances with individual positioning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable structure asset system, so that I can easily add new types of park structures in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing structure assets THEN the system SHALL provide a base structure interface or class
2. WHEN creating new structure types THEN they SHALL inherit common properties (position, rotation, scale)
3. WHEN managing structures THEN the system SHALL support adding, removing, and updating structure instances
4. WHEN structures are created THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing scene management system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a park visitor, I want to see realistic lamp lighting effects, so that the park feels more immersive during different times of day.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN lamps are rendered THEN they SHALL cast realistic shadows
2. WHEN it's dark or evening THEN lamps SHALL automatically activate their lighting
3. WHEN lamps emit light THEN the light SHALL have appropriate color temperature and intensity
4. WHEN multiple lamps are present THEN their lighting effects SHALL blend naturally
