# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an Inscryption-style shader that applies luminance-based posterization to create a distinctive visual aesthetic. The shader will posterize darker pixels aggressively to create deep blacks and hard shadows, while preserving color gradation in brighter areas to maintain text readability and fine details. This approach avoids the color banding issues of traditional posterization while achieving the game's signature dark, atmospheric look.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to have a distinctive dark visual style similar to Inscryption, so that the atmosphere feels mysterious and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shader is applied THEN darker pixels SHALL be posterized to a limited color palette creating deep blacks and hard shadows
2. WHEN the shader processes bright pixels THEN it SHALL preserve more color gradation to maintain visual clarity
3. WHEN text or UI elements are rendered THEN they SHALL remain readable despite the posterization effect
4. WHEN the shader is active THEN the overall visual style SHALL match the dark, atmospheric aesthetic of Inscryption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shader to use luminance-based thresholding, so that posterization intensity varies based on pixel brightness rather than applying uniformly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shader calculates pixel luminance THEN it SHALL use standard luminance formula (0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B)
2. WHEN a pixel's luminance is below the threshold THEN the shader SHALL apply aggressive posterization
3. WHEN a pixel's luminance is above the threshold THEN the shader SHALL apply minimal or no posterization
4. WHEN the luminance threshold is adjusted THEN the balance between posterized and preserved areas SHALL change accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable shader parameters, so that I can fine-tune the visual effect to match the desired aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the shader THEN it SHALL accept a luminance threshold parameter (0.0 to 1.0)
2. WHEN configuring the shader THEN it SHALL accept a color palette size parameter for posterization levels
3. WHEN configuring the shader THEN it SHALL accept intensity parameters to control the effect strength
4. WHEN parameters are modified THEN the visual changes SHALL be applied in real-time during development

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shader to integrate seamlessly with the existing rendering pipeline, so that it doesn't break current visual elements or performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shader is enabled THEN it SHALL work with the existing Three.js rendering setup
2. WHEN the shader processes frames THEN it SHALL maintain acceptable performance (60fps target)
3. WHEN the shader is applied THEN existing textures and materials SHALL be processed correctly
4. WHEN the shader is disabled THEN the game SHALL render normally without visual artifacts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shader implementation to be modular and maintainable, so that it can be easily modified or extended in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the shader THEN it SHALL be contained in separate shader files (vertex and fragment)
2. WHEN the shader is integrated THEN it SHALL use a dedicated shader material class
3. WHEN shader parameters need adjustment THEN they SHALL be easily accessible through a configuration interface
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the shader SHALL support toggling on/off for comparison
