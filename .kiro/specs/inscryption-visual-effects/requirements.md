# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements additional Inscryption-style visual effects to complement the existing posterization shader. The effects include low-resolution rendering with pixelation, chromatic aberration for lens distortion, film grain/noise for texture, optional vignette for edge darkening, and CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) effects for authentic retro monitor simulation. These effects will be implemented as Pixi.js v8 filters using TypeScript to achieve the complete retro aesthetic characteristic of Inscryption's visual style.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to have a pixelated retro look through low-resolution rendering, so that it matches Inscryption's distinctive visual style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game renders THEN it SHALL render to a low-resolution texture (480Ã—270 or configurable)
2. WHEN the low-resolution texture is displayed THEN it SHALL be upscaled using point filtering to avoid blur
3. WHEN the pixelation effect is active THEN sharp pixel boundaries SHALL be preserved without smoothing
4. WHEN the resolution setting is changed THEN the pixelation intensity SHALL adjust accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want chromatic aberration effects that create subtle lens distortion, so that the visual style feels more atmospheric and authentic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chromatic aberration is applied THEN RGB channels SHALL be offset slightly to create color fringing
2. WHEN the aberration is configured THEN it SHALL support both linear and radial distortion modes
3. WHEN aberration intensity is adjusted THEN the color separation SHALL change proportionally
4. WHEN aberration direction is modified THEN the effect orientation SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want film grain and noise effects that add texture to the image, so that the game feels gritty and atmospheric like Inscryption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN film grain is applied THEN random noise SHALL be added to all color channels
2. WHEN the grain animates THEN it SHALL use time-based variation for realistic movement
3. WHEN grain intensity is adjusted THEN the noise level SHALL change smoothly
4. WHEN the effect is enabled THEN it SHALL maintain consistent performance across different devices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an optional vignette effect that darkens screen edges, so that I can enhance the dark atmospheric feel when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vignette is enabled THEN screen edges SHALL be darkened with smooth falloff
2. WHEN vignette parameters are adjusted THEN intensity, radius, and falloff SHALL be configurable
3. WHEN vignette is disabled THEN the screen SHALL render without edge darkening
4. WHEN combined with other effects THEN vignette SHALL blend naturally without artifacts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all visual effects to work together seamlessly in Pixi.js v8, so that they can be combined for the complete Inscryption aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN they SHALL render in the correct order without conflicts
2. WHEN effects are combined THEN performance SHALL remain acceptable (60fps target)
3. WHEN filters are toggled THEN transitions SHALL be smooth without visual glitches
4. WHEN the rendering pipeline is active THEN it SHALL integrate with existing Pixi.js containers and sprites

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable parameters for all visual effects, so that I can fine-tune the aesthetic to match Inscryption's look precisely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring effects THEN each filter SHALL expose relevant parameters for adjustment
2. WHEN parameters are modified THEN changes SHALL be applied in real-time during development
3. WHEN saving configurations THEN settings SHALL persist and be easily manageable
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN individual effects SHALL be toggleable for comparison

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) effects that simulate an old monitor display, so that the game feels authentically retro and matches classic gaming aesthetics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CRT scanlines are enabled THEN horizontal lines SHALL be rendered across the screen with configurable spacing and intensity
2. WHEN CRT curvature is applied THEN the screen SHALL have subtle barrel distortion to simulate curved monitor glass
3. WHEN CRT phosphor glow is active THEN bright pixels SHALL have a subtle bloom effect mimicking phosphor persistence
4. WHEN CRT noise is enabled THEN subtle static interference SHALL be added to simulate analog signal imperfections
5. WHEN CRT brightness flicker is active THEN the overall brightness SHALL vary slightly over time to simulate power fluctuations
6. WHEN CRT effects are combined THEN all components SHALL work together seamlessly without performance degradation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the visual effects system to be maintainable and extensible, so that additional effects can be added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing filters THEN each effect SHALL be contained in separate, modular classes
2. WHEN adding new effects THEN the system SHALL support easy integration without breaking existing functionality
3. WHEN maintaining code THEN shader code SHALL be well-documented and organized
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN comprehensive error handling SHALL provide clear feedback
