# Multiplayer User Guide

This guide will help you connect with a friend and play AI Snap together using peer-to-peer multiplayer.

## Overview

AI Snap uses WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer connections between browsers. This means:
- ‚úÖ No server required
- ‚úÖ Works on static hosting (GitHub Pages, Vercel)
- ‚úÖ Low latency direct connection
- ‚úÖ Private - data goes directly between players
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual connection setup (copy/paste codes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited to 2 players

## What You Can Do Together

### Explore Together
- See your friend's position in real-time
- Watch where they're looking with the camera direction indicator
- Coordinate to find the best photo spots

### Photo Notifications
- When your friend takes a photo, you'll see a notification: "üì∏ Friend took a photo!"
- Great for coordinating group photography sessions

### Communication
- The game doesn't include voice or text chat
- Use a separate communication app (Discord, phone call, etc.) to talk while playing

## Connection Status Indicator

The multiplayer UI shows your connection status:

- **Disconnected** (Gray) - Not connected to anyone
- **Connecting** (Yellow) - Attempting to establish connection
- **Connected** (Green) - Successfully connected, shows latency (e.g., "Connected - 45ms")
- **Error** (Red) - Connection failed or lost

## Disconnecting

To end your multiplayer session:

1. Click the "Disconnect" button in the multiplayer UI
2. Or close the browser tab/window
3. The other player will see a "Disconnected" notification

To reconnect, you'll need to start the connection process again from the beginning.

## Tips for Best Experience

### Before Connecting

- ‚úÖ Make sure both players have the game fully loaded
- ‚úÖ Test your internet connection
- ‚úÖ Close unnecessary browser tabs to free up resources
- ‚úÖ Use Chrome or Edge for best compatibility

### During Connection

- ‚è±Ô∏è Be patient - connection can take 10-30 seconds
- üìã Copy the entire offer/answer code (they're long!)
- ‚úÖ Make sure no extra spaces or characters are added when copying
- üîÑ If it fails, try again - sometimes it takes a couple attempts

### While Playing

- üì∂ Keep your internet connection stable
- üéÆ Lower graphics settings if you experience lag
- üí¨ Use voice chat (Discord, etc.) for better coordination
- üì∏ Announce when you're taking photos for fun reactions!

## Understanding Latency

The connection status shows latency in milliseconds (ms):

- **< 50ms** - Excellent, very smooth
- **50-100ms** - Good, smooth gameplay
- **100-200ms** - Acceptable, slight delay
- **> 200ms** - High latency, may feel laggy

The game uses interpolation to smooth out movement even with higher latency.

## Privacy and Security

- Your connection is peer-to-peer (direct between browsers)
- No data is sent to any server
- Only game state is transmitted (position, camera, events)
- The offer/answer codes contain only WebRTC connection metadata
- Share codes only with people you trust

## Bandwidth Usage

The multiplayer system is designed to be bandwidth-efficient:

- **~3-4 KB/s** per direction during active play
- **10 updates per second** for smooth synchronization
- **Binary protocol** for minimal data size
- **~20-30 MB per hour** of gameplay

This should work fine on most internet connections, including mobile hotspots.

Happy exploring together! ü¶Åüì∏
